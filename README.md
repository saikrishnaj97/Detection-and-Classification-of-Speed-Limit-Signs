# Detection-and-Classification-of-Speed-Limit-Signs
Traffic sign detection and interpretation is an important element of advanced driver assistance systems in vehicles, and is integral to the development of fully autonomous vehicles. An important subset of traffic signs are signs that indicate that a speed limit is in operation, and for which correct detection is particularly critical. Camera-based technologies are an obvious way to achieve this goal and can be used in both autonomous vehicles and in vehicles with drivers as an aid to the driver. The objective of this mini-project is to develop a system to detect speed limit signs, and to determine the applicable speed limit, by processing a database of test images
